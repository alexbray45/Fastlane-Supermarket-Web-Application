    <h1>Accra's Lifestyle, Food & Culture</h1>
    <p>
        There are a lot to learn from a group of people by the way they piece together their meals. The ingredients, cooking methods and energy they apply into feeding themselves go beyond nourishment, as well as their culinary skills reflecting different beliefs, traditions and habits.

        <h2>1. Food in Accra </h2>
        <p>Food in Ghana tends to be hot and spicy, with ingredients like yams, cassava, maize, beans, plantains, and rice. Tropical fruits and vegetables supplement the diet. The mainstays of Ghanaian cuisine are sauces, 
            usually eaten with rice. Popular Ghanaian dishes include fufu, (a loved staple for most of West Africa) which is mashed ball made of cassava, yam or plantain that has been cooked and pounded into a semi-plastic state, 
            Ghanaian red-red--beans, shrimp or prawns, red palm oil, and tomatoes, and custard melkkos–custard with cinnamon.

            Other types of dishes usually served in Ghana are kenkey–traditionally prepared by boiling balls of mixed portions of fermented cooked maize meal and raw maize dough wrapped in dried cornhusk, 
            banku – fermented corn / cassava dough, cooked in hot water into a smooth whitish paste, and gari – made from fresh cassava which is grated and squeezed of excess liquid. 
            The remaining grated cassava is then fried over an open fire on a broad metal pan. The resulting product is crispy and crunchy to taste and is stored easily and can be eaten with stew or soup and fish.
            
            Street shops and markets are often filled with fresh foods with local taste. A popular dessert is fried plantain seasoned with chili pepper and ginger called kelewele.

    <p>
        The people of Ghana are warm and friendly. They are polite, open and trusting — even with strangers. In Ghanaian society, it is traditional to take life at a relaxed pace and view time as a series of events rather than a matter of hours or minutes.

        <h2>1.	Kakum National Park</h2>
        <p> A visit to Kakum National Park makes a great day trip,
            There you’ll find 40 mammal species, 300 bird species, and over 600 butterfly species.
            The most popular part of the park is the canopy walk.
