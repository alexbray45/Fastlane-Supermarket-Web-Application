                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Ghana, country of western Africa, situated on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea. <br>
                    Although relatively small in area and population, Ghana is one of the leading countries of Africa, <br>
                    partly because of its considerable natural wealth and partly because it was the first black African <br>
                    country south of the Sahara to achieve independence from colonial rule.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Ghana’s history includes myriad tales that come together to explain how the country has gotten to where it is today. The area now known as Ghana has seen battles with many African countries and was colonised by European nations over the last 2,000 years.
                Ghana existed as an empire from the 7th to the 13th centuries. During this time, the country was located at a higher elevation than where it’s found today, and the Ghanaian Empire included what we now know as Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. The ruler of this empire was known as the Warrior King – or the Ghana – which is how the empire became known to its enemies and allies.
                Towards the beginning of the medieval times, the empire was driven towards the coast by the rising Mali Empire. Later, during the Renaissance period, this clan of tribes – known as the Akan people – formed the Ashanti Empire, with their main seat being in the central woodlands of Kumasi.
                Ghana became powerful and wealthy from trading in gold and were pioneers in contacting Europeans.
                Although they were given a run for their money by many other kingdoms that make up modern Ghana, the Ashanti were able to maintain control over the coastal area for many years. This allowed them to trade with the Portuguese, Dutch and British.
                In the early 20th century, the British colonised the area as part of their commonwealth, naming it the “Gold Coast”. During this time, Ghanaians began trading on a global scale and grew their economy through the production of cocoa and coffee.</p>

        <h2>City</h2>
        <p>Ghana’s port city of Accra is the commercial hub of the country. It is also Ghana’s most populated city and the seat of its government.
            When travelling to Ghana, international visitors will stop off at Kotoka International Airport on their way to Accra. It’s also easy to travel to some of Ghana’s other important cities
            – like Kumasi in the forested Ashanti region, and Tamale in the northern region. Both of these destinations have international terminals.</p>
