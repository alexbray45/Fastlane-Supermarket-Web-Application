        <h2>3. Chale Wote Festival</h2>
        <p>The vibrant CHALE WOTE Street Art Festival, which gathered over 30,000 people, marks interactions between Ghana-based artists/educators

            sales and confinement during days of exploitation and systematization of colonialism. It is such a refreshing, alternative platform to reconnect with intuitive concepts 
            engineered for free form call-and-response expressions through performance, conversations and extensions of culture.
